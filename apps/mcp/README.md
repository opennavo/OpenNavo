# OpenNavo MCP

Python 3.13 + uv, using FastMCP 4.0.x. The 60 tools and 7 resources adapt only the internal `/agent-api`.

Run `uv sync --locked` in this directory. From the repository root, run `make gen-mcp lint-mcp test-mcp build-mcp` to generate and check artifacts. `make gen` and `make lint test` also include MCP. The authoritative tool manifest is `src/opennavo_mcp/tools/manifest.py`.

Before startup, supply `AGENT_GATEWAY_SECRET` through the process environment, matching the API secret. Optionally set `OPENNAVO_AGENT_API_BASE` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/agent-api`). Run `uv run --locked opennavo-mcp` to listen at `127.0.0.1:8790/mcp`; clients send Bearer tokens. stdio requires `OPENNAVO_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` and `OPENNAVO_TOKEN`. No .env files are loaded automatically. Never put real tokens in configuration examples or command-line arguments.

Top-level tool parameters use snake_case; nested fields retain OpenAPI camelCase. Write tools accept `dry_run=true`. All business output is wrapped in `untrusted`. Go performs final permission, deletion-allowance and quota checks; MCP caches introspection for 25 seconds. Go downloads URL uploads; MCP never contacts image sites.

The HTTP entry point trusts no forwarded IPs by default. Behind a reverse proxy, set `OPENNAVO_MCP_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to a JSON array of trusted CIDRs; never trust uncontrolled proxies. HTTP and stdio use the same permission middleware. `/healthz` returns liveness only.

Production Compose/Caddy integration is provided. Exercise deployment boundaries from the repository root with `node tooling/scripts/tasks/server.mjs prod-verify --mcp-only`.
